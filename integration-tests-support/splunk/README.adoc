=== Development information

* `Security` If no custom certificate is provided, splunk server creates its own one and the `SplunkTestResource` copies it from the container into `test-classes`
* `Security` Server certificate has to be signed (that is the reason of using keytool in the pom.xml)
* `Security` SSL connection can be verified by openssl tool
```
openssl s_client -connect localhost:32825 -CAfile cacert.pem
```
* `Security` Server certificate has to contain a private key, which could not be done via keytool itself. Proper way of achieving such certificate is to use Openssl tool. The `TestResource` is concatenating certificates and keys programmatically.
```
openssl pkcs12 -export -out combined.p12 -inkey localhost-key.pem -in localhost.pem -certfile splunkca.pem
openssl pkcs12 -in combined.p12 -out combined.pem -nodes
```
* Set log level to debug for `org.apache.camel.quarkus.test.support.splunk` (by adding `quarkus.log.category.\"org.apache.camel.quarkus.test.support.splunk\".level=DEBUG` into application.properties) to see more important information from runtime.
* `TestResource` is exporting configuration files, log and certificates to the `test-classes` folder.
* Splunk server takes a lot of time to start. It might be handy to start a test with a different process with some timeout (like several hours) and use FakeSplunkTestResource with hardcoded ports.
